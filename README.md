# Mario Party 3 on Xbox — the UWP port

How to take **Mario Party 3: Recompiled**
([`n64hub/mario-party-3-recomp`](https://github.com/n64hub/mario-party-3-recomp)) — a static
recompilation built on **N64Recomp + RT64** — to an **Xbox Series X in Developer Mode**.

*(Español: [README.es.md](README.es.md))*

The same recipe builds its two siblings, which share an engine
([`n64hub/mario-party-engine`](https://github.com/n64hub/mario-party-engine)) and pin the same
four library commits: [`marioparty2-xbox`](https://github.com/jajdp/marioparty2-xbox) and
[`marioparty-xbox`](https://github.com/jajdp/marioparty-xbox).

## Which console this was tested on

**An Xbox Series X**, in Developer Mode. Both consoles this was built and tested on are Series X,
so that is the only hardware anything here covers.

**A Series S has never been tried — not once.** It is a different machine: less memory available
to a game and a weaker GPU. This may work on one, it may run slower, or it may not start at all;
nothing here has been measured on it.

## Where this port stands

Built from the game's **v0.2.10**. The recipe was re-checked against it on 2026-11-02: the six
anchors `tools/parche_uwp_build.py` relies on all still apply, unchanged, on `v0.2.10` and on the
current `main` alike, so nothing here needed rewriting for the versions in between. This is the
one of the three that has actually been played, so it is the one with the most to say. Measured
on an Xbox Series X:

| | |
|---|---|
| ✅ Boots, draws and takes controller input | Package «Mario Party 3 Recomp» 0.1.0.5, built from v0.2.10 and installed through the Device Portal on 2026-11-02 |
| ✅ **60 FPS**, measured with the game's own counter | The logic runs at 30 Hz and RT64 interpolates; the counter reports presented frames |
| ✅ The launcher comes up, and the ROM validates by itself | From `LocalState`, with no dialog |
| ✅ The intro draws **complete**, at 1920×1080, with no black surfaces | The ubershader culling fix and the mipmap addressing fix doing their job from the first launch — see [`docs/HOW-IT-WORKS.md`](docs/HOW-IT-WORKS.md) |
| ✅ **Boards and minigames play** | Tested with a controller on an Xbox Series X on 2026-11-01 — on package **0.1.0.3**, built from v0.2.7. The 0.1.0.5 package above has been booted and measured, not yet played through with a controller |
| ✅ The opening cutscene is drawn at an exact 4:3 | 1438 × 1079 px, measured on the console itself, on package 0.1.0.5 |

**Six faults found while playing, and none of them is the port's.** All six are the game
project's, reproduce on its own Windows build, and are reported upstream. Four were fixed within
the day:

| | What it was | Where it stands |
|---|---|---|
| [#43](https://github.com/n64hub/mario-party-3-recomp/issues/43) | Everything flat drawn washed out and blown: the game switches the N64's gamma correction off at boot and that call was not reaching the recompiled code | **Fixed** by its author the same day, in v0.2.7. Measuring the same scene before and after, the old build is exactly the new one to the power 1/2.2 — the best-fitting exponent is **0.455**, with 0.21 levels of mean error out of 256 |
| [#48](https://github.com/n64hub/mario-party-3-recomp/issues/48) | The turn-change wipe is never drawn, so the board's spaces are seen vanishing group by group | **Fixed** in v0.2.9 |
| [#49](https://github.com/n64hub/mario-party-3-recomp/issues/49) | Minigames are stretched instead of kept at 4:3, which makes a couple of them very hard to play | **Fixed** in v0.2.8, with `RT64_SCISSOR_INSIDE_FRAMEBUFFER` |
| [#52](https://github.com/n64hub/mario-party-3-recomp/issues/52) | The board itself is redrawn squeezed to 4:3 at the first step of the turn-change wipe | **Fixed** in v0.2.10, confirmed here by measuring |
| [#54](https://github.com/n64hub/mario-party-3-recomp/issues/54) | The **characters** are still squeezed to 0.75 of their width during the wipe, about the screen's centre, while the board and the scenery are not | **Open.** Measured on three turn changes: it is every character, not only the active one, and it survives both Vulkan and frame interpolation being off |
| [#55](https://github.com/n64hub/mario-party-3-recomp/issues/55) | With interpolation on, the characters are drawn in each other's places during the opening cutscene | **Open**, but a fix is already on `main` (PR #56, `model_ids.cpp`), in no release yet |

**What is NOT claimed here:** that a whole party runs cleanly end to end.

## What this repository is

**A recipe, not a product.** There is no ROM, no recompiled code, no executable and no `.msix`
here — and that is deliberate, not an oversight.

| Piece | What it is |
|---|---|
| [`tools/compilar.ps1`](tools/compilar.ps1) | **The whole recipe**, in five steps you can repeat one at a time: ROM, recompile, patch, static libraries, appx. With the *why* of each decision beside it |
| [`tools/parche_uwp_build.py`](tools/parche_uwp_build.py) | The three changes **the game itself** needs: the `UWP_BUILD` option, renaming `main()`, and `SDL_INIT_HAPTIC`. By exact anchors, idempotent |
| [`tools/resolver_conflictos.py`](tools/resolver_conflictos.py) | The four conflicts worleydl's UWP patches hit on this tree, and why all four resolve the same way: **keep both sides** |
| [`tools/sellar.cmake`](tools/sellar.cmake) | Re-stamps the web patches of `N64Recomp-browser` so the next configure does not try to apply them again and die |
| [`docs/HOW-IT-WORKS.md`](docs/HOW-IT-WORKS.md) | The two builds, and the ten traps that cost real time |
| [`docs/INSTALL.md`](docs/INSTALL.md) | What you need, the five commands, and getting it onto the console |

Unlike most of the ports in this catalogue, **the changes to the game are published here**: the
game is GPL-3.0, so its code can be quoted. What is quoted, how much and from where is measured
in [`NOTICE.md`](NOTICE.md).

## The two things to understand before trying

**1. The Visual Studio generator will NOT do for the game's libraries.** MSBuild only has the
`v143` toolset for "Application Type = UWP", not `ClangCL`, so `-T ClangCL` with `WindowsStore`
gives `error MSB8020`; and with `cl.exe` the whole ecosystem falls over, because it is written
for clang (`-Wno-*` in ultramodern and recompinput, `C4146` as an error in rabbitizer). The right
way is **Ninja + clang-cl**, with the libraries as a **desktop** target: what makes them UWP is
the `_UWP` macro the patches define. The only genuine `WindowsStore` project is the appx one.

**2. The platform work comes from worleydl's forks**, not from here: `rt64-dev` (branch
`uwp-dk64`), `N64ModernRuntime-dev` (`uwp-rebase`), `RecompFrontend-dev` (`uwp-compat`) and the
[`worleydl/uwp-dep`](https://github.com/worleydl/uwp-dep) bundle. ⚠ That bundle **has one branch
per engine**: for this family it is `rt64`, not the commit the Star Fox 64 fork pins, whose
`libuwp` does not export `uwp_PickMultipleFiles` and leaves the link unfinished.

**And the good news, which is what made this port a one-evening job:** Mario Party pins
`rt64` at `5473732`, `N64ModernRuntime` at `cdf5abb` and `RecompFrontend` at `b2c5c18` — within a
commit or two of what worleydl's patches were cut against. Three of the four apply with
`--3way`; the fourth needs no conflict resolution at all.

## The traps

Every one of these came up on the console. They are written out in
[`docs/HOW-IT-WORKS.md`](docs/HOW-IT-WORKS.md); the short list:

| | What happens |
|---|---|
| 1 | **`patches/` needs a clang with a MIPS backend.** Visual Studio's clang-cl does not have one |
| 2 | ⚠ **But the linker must not be LLD 22**: it no longer accepts `-nostdlib`, which `patches/Makefile` passes. LLD 19 does |
| 3 | ⚠ **`vcvars64.bat` rebuilds `PATH` and drops Windows' git.** MSYS2's git answers in Unix paths, `apply.cmake` cannot find its stamp, and the configure dies in a three-way merge |
| 4 | ⚠ **The web patches' stamp goes stale** the moment the UWP patch touches the same files. Re-stamp before every configure |
| 5 | **`git apply --3way` wants the state in the index**: `add -A` before… and `reset` after, or you break trap 4 |
| 6 | **A duplicate symbol between the patch and the game** (`osPfsIsPlug_recomp`). The game's wins |
| 7 | **`AddVectoredExceptionHandler` is not declared for UWP** — `error C3861`. Declare it by hand |
| 8 | ⚠ **`SDL_INIT_HAPTIC` does not exist in WinRT's SDL**, and `SDL_Init` returns -1 **for the whole set**, so the window is never created |
| 9 | ⚠ **Portable mode is no way around the data folder.** `FOLDERID_LocalAppData` returns a folder the Device Portal does not expose; it has to be `LocalFolder` |
| 10 | **To test with nobody in front of the console** you need two switches, and both are **files** in `LocalState` |

## What it is not

No **ROM**, no recompiled code, no executable, no appx, no game art. Not worleydl's patches
either — they are in his repositories — nor the UWP bundle, nor the `uwp/` wrapper project
itself, which derives from his. What this repository holds is the recipe, the four tools, and the
record of what went wrong.

**Almost none of what makes this work is ours.** This repository is a recipe that glues together other people's work; without any one of these pieces there would be no port at all.
